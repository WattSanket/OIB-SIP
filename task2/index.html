                Digital India was launched on July 1, 2015, by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Digital India is a Government of India initiative aiming at improving the online infrastructure and enhancing internet connectivity. The motto of Digital India is “Power to Empower”. The nine pillars of Digital India are Broadband Highways, Universal
                Access to Mobile Connectivity, Public Internet Access Programme, e-Governance: Reforming Government through Technology, e-Kranti - Electronic Delivery of Services, Information for All, Electronics Manufacturing, IT for Jobs and Early Harvest Programmes.

                Each of these areas is a complex programme in itself and cuts across multiple Ministries and Departments. Digital Infrastructure Creation, Digital Delivery of Services, and Digital Literacy are the three main components of the Digital India initiative. The key objective is providing high-speed internet in every part of the country and improving the online infrastructure.

                <strong>The Digital Revolution!</strong><br>
                After correct implementation of these schemes we started experiencing the results as well. Making the less dependency on paper work DigiLocker plays a vital role, which helps in storing important documents at one place. E-Health and E-Education campaigns were launched helping in providing better storage of health records and very interactive learning of topics or subjects through e-learning. Various platforms were also launched which helps in getting the required items delivered at doorstep. It was like a digital revolution.

                In this revolution, we find our best ever digital platform named UPI, which helped India in many ways. Through UPI, India's most of the transactions goes digital and dependency over cash became less. In 2022, UPI processed over 7,400 crore transactions, worth Rs 12 5.94 lakh crore, according to NPCI data. In 2021, the platform processed over 38 billion transactions worth Rs 71.54 trillion. Showing the increasing number of transactions, it indicates how India is being digitalized. Another important platform is DBT-Direct Benefit Transfer, through which money is directly transferred into the beneficiary's account.

                To conclude, if you notice the page started by addressing the same problem in the 2nd paragraph. The result is clear that ultimately the problem was resolved by our PM Narendra Modi. Hence, we all can say that India is moving forward and advancing with great technologies which are inspired by Digital India (“Power to Empower”).
